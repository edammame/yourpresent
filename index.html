        Even though you still radiate your positive energy even when life wasn’t the kindest on you. 
        If you sometimes you want to live your day as it is without bothering to be energized, it's okay. 
        If you’re tired, you don’t have to always listen to anyone or cheer anybody up. Give yourself a peaceful time.
        <br>
        <br>
        I know you always get a grip on yourself and you did well, so please continue being Haura Khansa. 
        Do whatever you want to do in your life, make anything you like, keep thriving on your path, love.
        <br>
        <br>
        Take care of yourself, listen to what your body needs, don’t ever neglect any symptoms you had, eat healthily, 
        make time for exercise once a week, sleep well, and never take things too personally.
